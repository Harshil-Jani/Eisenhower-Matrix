# EisenHower

Manage your tasks and manage your life by using the EisenHower-Matrix. I learned about this from a blog post by a guy who calls himself as "Flying Cakes" and I personally love the way he manages his life. I found this approach pretty interesting and I decided to apply this in my life as well. Since , The basic principle follows that in order to save time management is important but if you over-manage your life you may lose time to learn and develop and get stuck only in planning rather than executing. So, I went on the search for a perfect EisenHower app and got this one.

I am tweaking it as per my uses and satisfaction rather than writing whole app in some fancy new technology. And so, you can do the same with the help of open source. 

### EisenHower Matrix

The Eisenhower Matrix, also referred to as Urgent-Important Matrix, helps you decide on and prioritize tasks by urgency and importance, sorting out less urgent and important tasks which you should either delegate or not do at all. Dwight D. Eisenhower was the 34th President of the United States from 1953 until 1961. Before becoming President, he served as a general in the United States Army and as the Allied Forces Supreme Commander during World War II. He also later became NATOâ€™s first supreme commander.
Dwight had to make tough decisions continuously about which of the many tasks he should focus on each day. This finally led him to invent the world-famous Eisenhower principle, which today helps us prioritize by urgency and importance.

### Building the App

You'll need the latest NPM, as well as familiarity with running commands from the terminal.

1. Clone the repo.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`; a development server will start and the app will be accessible on `http://localhost:9000`.
1. Make any changes, and they'll be reflected in real time with React Hot Loader.
